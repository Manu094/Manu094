Hi!
I'm Emmanuel, but you can call me Manu.
I'm actually no developper, coding is my hobby and I love it
I'm currently gathering knowledge about the C language, as I find it very educative. It's really helped me understand more about programming concepts in general.
However, in the past weeks, I've been far too invested in learning all things Neovim related, which has undoubtedly hindered my C coding time.
