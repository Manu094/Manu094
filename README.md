Hi!
I'm Emmanuel, but you can call me Manu. I have recently picked an interest in code, and have grown particularly interested in web developpement in recent times.
I am learning from multiple sources, mainly Codecademy at the moment, but I naturally wander on youtube and stackexchange quite a lot.
